# kmer_identifier
This is the repository for the Bioinformatics Programming and System Management coursework as part of the MSc in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology.

Kmer_Identifier is a Python-based programme facilitates the identification of short nucleotide subsequences (i.e. kmers) with unexpected distributions in biological data generated from Next generation sequencing platforms. It is specifically designed for analysing FASTQ-formatted files, one of the most common and most accepted file format for storing the output of high-throughput next generation sequencing platforms.
